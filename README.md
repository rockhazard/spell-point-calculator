# Spell Point Calculator

## Description
A JavaScript utility designed to assist players in tracking spell points for the variant player rules in the 5th Edition D&D _Dungeon Master's Guide_ on page 288.

Traditionally, a caster must use spell slots to keep track of spells.  For instance, a level 4 wizard will normally have 4 level 1 spells, and 2 level 2 spells.  This is easy to keep track of, but limiting, since you can't sacrifice your level 1 spells to increase the number of level 2 spells available.  Spell points solve this problem at the cost of complexity, giving the player a pool of points to use as he or she sees fit on any available spell levels.  For instance, a caster may choose to spend all magic on level 2 spells, exhausting the ability to cast any level 1 spells, but gaining more castings of the more powerful spells in the bargain.  This utility aims to remove the complexity of keeping track of these spell points.

## Features
- #### Level Selection:
Automatically calculates maximum spell points according to caster level after a caster's long rest.
- #### Arcane Recovery:
Warns when spell points reach 50% of maximum, then allows the player to add half their maximum spell points through a short rest.
- #### Manually Add Points:
Allows player to manually add or remove points in case of mistakes.
- #### School Selection with Level Titles:
Pick your caster's school of magic and display an associated msytic symbol along with level titles that reflect the special features of your arcane tradition.  You get a new title at each level where your tradition bestows new powers.
